2022 Advent of Code solutions
==========================================

I chose to write this year's solutions in Rust. I know I'm writing bad code,
I'm optimizing for development time, not code quality. Once I get the right answer
I stop making edits.

I have not spent any time benchmarking the code.

To run a solution invoke the program with Cargo:

```
$ cargo run --bin aoc01
```

If you have questions about the code, please open an issue and ask away!
Beginner questions are very much welcome.
